📚Web Scraper using Python

A simple yet powerful Python web scraping project that extracts book details (name, price, and rating) from the demo e-commerce website Books to 
Scrape.
The extracted data is saved into a CSV file for easy analysis and visualization.

📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to use Python’s Requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to scrape structured data from a web page.
It’s a great beginner-friendly project to learn the basics of web scraping, data extraction, and CSV handling.

✅ Features
✔ Scrapes book title, price, and rating from each product
✔ Exports the data into a CSV file (products.csv)
✔ Uses BeautifulSoup for clean HTML parsing
✔ Handles HTTP requests and errors gracefully.

🧩 Technologies Used
🐍 Python 3
🌐 Requests (for fetching HTML content)
🍜 BeautifulSoup (bs4) (for parsing and extracting data)
📊 CSV module (for saving data)

💻 Python Code
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import csv

URL = "https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/page-1.html"
response = requests.get(URL)
response.raise_for_status()  # check for request errors
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

products = soup.find_all('article', class_='product_pod')

with open('products.csv', 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["Product Name", "Price", "Rating"])

    for product in products:
        name = product.h3.a['title']
        price = product.find('p', class_='price_color').text
        rating = product.p['class'][1]  # rating class (e.g., "Three", "Five")
        
        writer.writerow([name, price, rating])

print("✅ Data saved successfully to 'products.csv'").
